# crashlytics
Crashlytics plugin for gameclosure

android:
- main jar file(hc-crashlytics) is generated by combining all other jars using any jar combiner tool. eg.(http://ninjacave.com/jarsplice).
- These jar files are obtained by integrating crashlytic to a sample android project using android studio.
- devtool is required since we are using ant build (https://www.fabric.io/downloads/ant).
- We need to add custom rules defined by devtool for ant build. This is done by onCreateProject hook.

ios:
- build script is a template for build phases in xcode project.
- Specify **crashlyticsBuildSecret** and **crashlyticsKey** in your devkit project manifest
